== Introduction and Goals

=== System Vision and Purpose

JBake is a Java-based static site generator designed for developers who want to "bake" websites from content written in markup languages. The core metaphor: *JBake is like an oven that transforms raw ingredients (markup content, templates, assets) into a fully-baked website (HTML files)*.

**Primary Purpose:**

* Convert markup documents (Markdown, AsciiDoc, HTML) into static HTML websites
* Provide a blog-aware generator with support for posts, pages, tags, and archives
* Enable template-driven rendering with multiple template engine options
* Support developer workflows with live preview and incremental building

**Key Business Goals:**

1. **Developer Productivity**: Enable rapid website creation without complex frameworks
2. **Flexibility**: Support multiple markup languages and template engines
3. **Simplicity**: Provide "convention over configuration" approach with sensible defaults
4. **Extensibility**: Allow plugins and customization through Java SPI mechanism

=== Requirements Overview

**Essential Features:**

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Feature |Description

|Content Processing
|Parse and convert multiple markup formats (Markdown, AsciiDoc, HTML) to HTML

|Template Rendering
|Support multiple template engines (Freemarker, Groovy, Thymeleaf, Pebble, Jade)

|Blog Support
|Generate blog structures with posts, pages, archives, tags, and RSS feeds

|Asset Management
|Copy static assets and handle asset folders

|Incremental Builds
|Detect changed files and rebuild only what's necessary

|Live Preview
|Built-in Jetty server for local preview during development

|Caching
|OrientDB-based content cache for performance optimization

|Data Files
|Support external data files (JSON, YAML) for template injection
|===

**Target Users:**

* Developers creating personal blogs or documentation sites
* Teams building static websites with version-controlled content
* Technical writers using AsciiDoc or Markdown
* Users migrating from other static site generators

=== Requirements Overview

**Core Requirements:**

1. **Content Crawling**: Recursively scan content folder and parse markup files
2. **Incremental Processing**: SHA1-based change detection to avoid redundant processing
3. **Template Selection**: Automatic template matching based on document type
4. **Output Generation**: Write rendered HTML to destination folder
5. **Asset Handling**: Copy static files (CSS, JS, images) to output
6. **Preview Server**: Serve generated site locally for development

=== Quality Goals

|===
|Priority |Quality Goal |Motivation & Scenarios

|1
|**Extensibility**
|Support multiple markup and template engines without modifying core code. New engines can be added via Java SPI mechanism. *Scenario*: A developer wants to add support for a new template engine - they implement AbstractTemplateEngine, register via META-INF/services, and JBake auto-discovers it.

|2
|**Performance** 
|Process large sites efficiently through caching and incremental builds. *Scenario*: When rebuilding a 1000-page site, only changed files are reprocessed. OrientDB cache stores parsed content with SHA1 hashing for change detection.

|3
|**Simplicity**
|Provide zero-configuration startup with sensible defaults. *Scenario*: Running `jbake -i -b` on an empty folder creates example project structure and generates the site immediately without requiring configuration files.

|4
|**Modularity**
|Clear separation between parsing, rendering, and output stages. *Scenario*: Template engine failures don't crash the crawler; each rendering tool handles its own errors independently.

|5
|**Compatibility**
|Maintain backwards compatibility with existing projects. *Scenario*: Deprecated constructors and methods are kept with @Deprecated annotations, allowing gradual migration to new APIs while supporting legacy code.

=== Stakeholders

[options="header",cols="1,2,3"]
|===
|Role/Name |Contact |Expectations

|**End Users** (Bloggers & Technical Writers)
|User community via mailing list, forum
|Easy-to-use tool for creating static sites; good documentation; support for popular markup formats; fast build times

|**Contributors** (Core Developers)
|GitHub jbake-org/jbake
|Clean, maintainable architecture; clear extension points; comprehensive tests; backwards compatibility

|**Plugin Developers**
|External developers
|Well-documented SPI interfaces; stable APIs for template engines, markup parsers, and rendering tools; minimal dependencies

|**Embedding Projects**
|JBake Maven Plugin, Gradle Plugin users
|Programmatic API access; configuration flexibility; ability to run JBake embedded in build tools

|**Site Maintainers**
|jbake.org documentation team
|Dogfooding: JBake documentation site uses JBake itself (with DocToolchain); need stable, reliable builds

|**Java Ecosystem**
|Maven Central consumers
|Semantic versioning; proper dependency management; Java 8+ compatibility
|===

=== Technical Roadmap (Next 12 Months)

**Planned Enhancements:**

* Java 11+ as minimum version (migrate from Java 8)
* Improved incremental build performance
* Better error reporting with context
* Modern template engine support (consider removing legacy engines)
* Enhanced CLI with picocli improvements
* Migration guide for breaking changes

**Deprecation Plans:**

* Legacy constructor patterns with File/CompositeConfiguration parameters → JBakeConfiguration-based constructors
* Direct OrientDB API exposure → Abstract ContentStore methods
* Mutable configuration via setters → Immutable configuration builders
