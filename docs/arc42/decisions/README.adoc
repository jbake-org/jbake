= Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) documenting significant architectural decisions in JBake.

== ADR Timeline & Evolution Phases

=== Phase 1: Foundation (2012-2014) - "Get it Working"

* link:ADR-001-pipeline-architecture.adoc[ADR-001]: Pipeline Architecture
* link:ADR-002-spi-extensibility.adoc[ADR-002]: Java SPI for Extensibility 
* link:ADR-003-orientdb-cache.adoc[ADR-003]: OrientDB Embedded Database

**Context:** Initial design focused on proving the concept of a Java-based static site generator. Primary concerns were simplicity and getting core features working.

=== Phase 2: Maturity (2015-2017) - "Make it Extensible"

* link:ADR-004-delegating-template-engine.adoc[ADR-004]: Delegating Template Engine Pattern
* link:ADR-005-configuration-abstraction.adoc[ADR-005]: Configuration Abstraction Layer
* link:ADR-006-incremental-builds.adoc[ADR-006]: SHA1-based Incremental Builds

**Context:** User base growing, requests for multiple template engines and better performance. Focus shifted to extensibility without sacrificing simplicity.

=== Phase 3: Modernization (2018-Present) - "Reduce Tech Debt"

* link:ADR-007-deprecation-strategy.adoc[ADR-007]: Backwards Compatibility via Deprecation
* link:ADR-008-java-version-policy.adoc[ADR-008]: Java Version Support Policy

**Context:** Balance between innovation and stability. Support legacy projects while modernizing codebase for future enhancements.

== Decision Status Legend

* ✅ **Accepted**: Active and implemented
* 🔄 **Superseded**: Replaced by newer decision (see "Superseded by" section)
* ❌ **Deprecated**: Being phased out
* 🤔 **Proposed**: Under discussion

== Template for New ADRs

When adding new ADRs, use this format (see individual ADRs for examples):

```adoc
= ADR-XXX: [Title]

Status: [Accepted|Proposed|Deprecated|Superseded]

Date: YYYY-MM-DD

== Problem Statement

What problem are we solving?

== Context

Background, constraints, and forces at play.

== Decision

What we decided to do.

== Consequences

=== Positive

* Benefits and advantages

=== Negative

* Drawbacks and limitations

=== Neutral

* Other impacts

== Alternatives Considered

=== Pugh Matrix

| Criterion        | Baseline | Alt 1 | Alt 2 |
|-----------------|----------|-------|-------|
| Criterion 1     | 0        | +1    | -1    |
| Total Score     | 0        | X     | Y     |

== Contributing ADRs

When making significant architectural decisions:

1. Create new ADR file with next number
2. Fill in all sections (Problem, Context, Decision, Consequences, Alternatives)
3. Include Pugh Matrix for alternatives evaluation
4. Update this README with timeline entry and topic links
5. Reference ADR in related code documentation
