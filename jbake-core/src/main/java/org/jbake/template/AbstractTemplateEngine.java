/**
 * A template is responsible for converting a model into a rendered document. The model
 * consists of key/value pairs, some of them potentially converted from a markup language
 * to HTML already.
 *
 * An appropriate rendering engine will be chosen by JBake based on the template suffix. If
 * contents is not available in the supplied model, a template has access to the document
 * database in order to complete the model. It is in particular interesting to optimize
 * data access based on the underlying template engine capabilities.
 *
 * Note that some rendering engines may rely on a different rendering model than the one
 * provided by the first argument of {@link #renderDocument(java.util.Map, String, java.io.Writer)}.
 * In this case, it is the responsibility of the engine to convert it.
